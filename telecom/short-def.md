short definition of various components related to telecommunication technologies

- **Node B**: Base stations that transmit and receive radio signals to/from mobile devices (UEs).
- **Radio Network Controller (RNC)**: A central entity that controls one or more Node Bs, providing control functionalities and managing radio resources.
- **UMTS**: is a third-generation (3G) mobile cellular system that allows 2G GSM networks to migrate to 3G
- **MSC**: is responsible for *voice beares*
- **SGSN**: is responsible for *data session bearer*
- **SP**: (Signaling points) Any node in network, working with signals, is called a signaling point or SP
	- SSP: Service Switching Point, originates and terminates calls. (e.g. MSC)
	- STP: Signaling Transfer Point, acts as router in network based on routing information in SS7 message
	- SCP: Service Control Point, any node taht supports application database (e.g. HLR, SMSC, AUC, EIR)
- **STN-SR in SRVCC**: it identifies the session for routing the call to the IMS network.
- **SIGTRAN**: A set of protocols that enables the transportation of Signaling System 7 (SS7) messages over Internet Protocol (IP) networks
- **IS-41**: also known as ANSI-41, is a mobile, cellular telecommunications system standard that supports mobility management by enabling the networking of switches
- **E1**: is a standard for digital telecommunications that carries data at a rate of 2.048 megabits per second (Mbps)
