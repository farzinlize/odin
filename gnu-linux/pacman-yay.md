Managing packages in **Arch Linux** is primarily done using the built-in package manager, **Pacman**, and for **AUR (Arch User Repository)** packages, many users rely on an AUR helper like **Yay**. Below is a comprehensive guide covering all the essential and advanced scenarios you might encounter when installing, removing, searching, and managing packages using both **Pacman** and **Yay**.

---

## 🛠️ PACMAN: Official Repositories

### 🔍 1. Search for Packages
```bash
pacman -Ss <package_name>
```
Example:
```bash
pacman -Ss firefox
```

> This searches in official repositories only.

---

### 📦 2. Install Packages
```bash
sudo pacman -S <package_name>
```
Example:
```bash
sudo pacman -S firefox vlc code
```

Install without confirmation:
```bash
sudo pacman -Sy --noconfirm <package_name>
```

---

### 🔄 3. Update System
Update package database and upgrade all installed packages:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

Only update the database:
```bash
sudo pacman -Sy
```

---

### ❌ 4. Remove Packages
Remove a single package:
```bash
sudo pacman -R <package_name>
```

Remove a package and its dependencies that are no longer needed:
```bash
sudo pacman -Rs <package_name>
```

Remove package but keep dependencies:
```bash
sudo pacman -Rdd <package_name>
```

---

### 💾 5. Clean Cache
Remove cached packages (old versions):
```bash
sudo pacman -Sc
```

Remove all cached packages:
```bash
sudo pacman -Scc
```

---

### 📁 6. Query Installed Packages
Check if a package is installed:
```bash
pacman -Qs <package_name>
```

List all installed packages:
```bash
pacman -Qe
```

List explicitly installed packages:
```bash
pacman -Qe
```

List all packages (including dependencies):
```bash
pacman -Qa
```

---

### 🧰 7. Reinstall/Upgrade Specific Package
Reinstall a package:
```bash
sudo pacman -S <package_name> --force
```

Upgrade a specific package:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu <package_name>
```

---

### 🧩 8. Install from Local `.pkg.tar.zst` file
```bash
sudo pacman -U /path/to/package.pkg.tar.zst
```

---

### 🧹 9. Remove Orphaned Dependencies
Packages installed as dependencies but no longer required:
```bash
sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)
```

---

### 🗂️ 10. List Files Owned by a Package
```bash
pacman -Ql <package_name>
```

---

### 📄 11. Show Info About a Package
```bash
pacman -Qi <package_name>
```

For remote (repo) info:
```bash
pacman -Si <package_name>
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 YAY: AUR Helper

Before using Yay, make sure it's installed:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

---

### 🔍 1. Search AUR Packages
```bash
yay -Ss <package_name>
```

Search with regex or fuzzy matching:
```bash
yay -Ssa <regex>
```

---

### 📦 2. Install AUR Packages
```bash
yay -S <package_name>
```

Install with custom flags or edit PKGBUILD:
```bash
yay -S --editmenu <package_name>
```

Install without confirmation:
```bash
yay -S --noconfirm <package_name>
```

---

### 🔄 3. Update AUR Packages
Update system including AUR:
```bash
yay -Syu --aur
```

Or just update AUR packages:
```bash
yay -Au --aur
```

Update all packages including AUR:
```bash
yay -Syu
```

---

### ❌ 4. Remove AUR Packages
Use `pacman` to remove AUR-installed packages:
```bash
sudo pacman -R <package_name>
```

Remove with config files and unused deps:
```bash
sudo pacman -Rsc <package_name>
```

---

### 📋 5. Build Only (No Install)
Download and build package but don't install:
```bash
yay -G <package_name>
```

Build and install manually:
```bash
yay -Gb <package_name>
```

---

### 🧩 6. Upgrade All AUR Packages
```bash
yay -Au --aur
```

Upgrade only AUR packages:
```bash
yay -Au --onlyaur
```

---

### 🧵 7. View Build Log
If a package fails to build, check the log:
```bash
less ~/.cache/yay/<package_name>/build.log
```

---

### 🧼 8. Clean AUR Cache
Clean uninstalled AUR packages:
```bash
yay -Sc
```

Clean all AUR cache:
```bash
yay -Scc
```

---

### 📥 9. Download Only (PKGBUILD + Sources)
Download source files and PKGBUILD:
```bash
yay -G <package_name>
```

---

### 📝 10. Edit PKGBUILD Before Building
Install with interactive menu:
```bash
yay -S --editmenu <package_name>
```

---

### 📊 11. Display Stats and Top Voted Packages
Show top voted AUR packages:
```bash
yay -Slr
```

Show stats about your AUR usage:
```bash
yay --stats
```

---

## 🧪 Advanced & Mixed Scenarios

### 🔄 Simultaneous Install (Official + AUR)
```bash
yay -S firefox visual-studio-code-bin
```

This will install Firefox from official repos and VS Code from AUR.

---

### 🧱 Handle Conflicts
If two packages conflict:
```bash
yay -S conflicting-package --asdeps
```

Or manually resolve conflicts using:
```bash
sudo pacman -Rdd conflicting-package
```

Then proceed with installation.

---

### 🧬 Install from Git URL (Manual AUR Clone)
Sometimes you need to manually clone and install from AUR:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/package-name.git
cd package-name
makepkg -si
```

---

### 📁 Find Which Package Provides a File
If you want to find which package provides `/usr/bin/somefile`:
```bash
pacman -Fy   # First update the file database
pacman -Fx /usr/bin/somefile
```

---

### 🧷 Install Development Versions (Git/SVN)
Some AUR packages end in `-git`, `-svn`, etc. These are development builds:
```bash
yay -S neovim-git
```

These get updated more frequently and may have breaking changes.

---

### 🧳 Install Packages Without Root (Locally)
Use `--prefix` with `makepkg` (advanced), or use tools like `paru` or `yay` with user-mode support.

---

### 🧪 Debugging Failed Installs
- Check logs: `~/.cache/yay/<pkgname>`
- Use `--editmenu` to tweak the PKGBUILD.
- Ensure all base-devel tools are installed:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S base-devel
  ```
